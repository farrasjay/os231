## Week 01

1. [RexEgg](https://www.rexegg.com/)<br>
All about regular expressions (regex), tutorials & cheatsheets. Helped me a lot while i was doing my W01 filter.sh script.

2. [Unix StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)<br>
Basically pretty similar to StackOverflow except this one is more centered in Unix & Linux stuffs. Always been helpful so far.
